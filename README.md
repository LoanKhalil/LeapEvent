Given database schema from skillsAssessmentEvents.db, I was able to use AI to generate a lot of the boiler plate code for the data access layer as well as the necessary services and api controller.
Repository code did need to be adjusted.

I chose to use Angular for the frontend, which again a lot of the code was generated using AI.
I added the use of indexDB for caching on the client side.

Sadly, a lot of time was actually spent deploying the app/api to Azure, due to unexpected build output location and environment setup.
